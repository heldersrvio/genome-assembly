# genome-assembly

Division of an input DNA sequence into k-mers and its reassembly. Written in Python. 'kdMer' receives an input file (input.fasta) with the entire sequence plus the k and d values and outputs the corresponding k-mers (sorted alphabetically) on output.txt. The Assembler program then uses that output as its input and outputs the original DNA sequence on output.fasta.
